Instructions:
  - only show the files and folders listed in the "Show" section
  - hide all other files and folders, including those listed in the "Hide" section
  - path matching is exact (use the real folder names and numbering)
  - the * means all files under one child path segment from the exact path
  - the */* means all files under two child path segments from the exact path
  - consider that the sections Show+Hide of the "settings.yaml" may change with commits 
  - thus, the portal needs to read the file in runtime, and decide what to do on the fly
  - in other words, don't hardcode what is to show or hide
Show:
  - /README.md
  - /1 🎯 Mission/*
  - /2 🏔️ Landscape/*/*
  - /4 ⚙️ Solution/40 👥 Domains/*/*
