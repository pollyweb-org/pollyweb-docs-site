Instructions:
  - only show the files and folders listed in the "Show" section
  - hide all other files and folders, including those listed in the "Hide" section
  - the * means all files in a folder
  - the */* means all files in all subfolders of a folder
  - consider that the sections Show+Hide of the "settings.yaml" may change with commits 
  - thus, the portal needs to read the file in runtime, and decide what to do on the fly
  - in other words, don't hardcode what is to show or hide
Show:
  - /README.md
  - /1 🎯 Mission/*/*
